This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Pick your polish

Simple application to randomize a nail polish color from my list of available colors.  Also has the ability to view the full color list.

--Wanted to practice using Tailwind CSS for this project.

--Will eventually include a way for users to add their own list of colors.

### Getting Started

Deployed app can be seen here:  https://extraordinary-sorbet-2bdb2f.netlify.app



First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Click randomize to see a random color.  Remove randomizer will remove the color from the screen.  Click view all to toggle between full color list and then removing.
